#Scanner
   Our scanner uses the same logic as a finite state automata. As the scanner takes in tokens, it switches states for when it is looking for a token, when it is taking an integer, and when it is taking in a string. It switches through these states to treat each token or character appropriately, and returns the type of each individual token.
